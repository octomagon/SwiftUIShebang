# SwiftUIShebang
---
This is a short-as-possible Swift shebang script that opens a window using SwiftUI.  
No Xcode project, XIB or Storyboard.  Just 42 lines of Swift.  

I made this because I'm writing a command-line app that may on occasion want to open a native macOS window.  I also wanted to see how easy this would be with SwiftUI.  If anybody knows a way to do this in less lines of code, please let me know.  Almost all of the 42 lines is just ripped from the boiler-plate code that Xcode gives you.
